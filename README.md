# 🌍 REST Countries API with Color Theme Switcher

Welcome to my solution for the **REST Countries API Challenge** on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). This project showcases my ability to build a dynamic web app using **Vue.js**, **REST APIs**, and a **dark/light theme toggle**.

---

## 📜 Challenge Overview

### **Objective**
Build a web app that fetches data from the **REST Countries API** and displays it in a responsive and user-friendly manner.

### **Features**
Your users should be able to:
- 🌍 See all countries from the API on the homepage.
- 🔍 Search for a country using an input field.
- 🌎 Filter countries by region.
- 🗺️ Click on a country to see detailed information on a separate page.
- ➡️ Navigate to border countries from the detail page.
- 🌓 Toggle between light and dark mode for the entire app.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: For building the interactive and component-based UI.
- **CSS3**: For responsive design and theming.
- **LocalStorage**: To save the user’s theme preference.
- **Vite**: As the development and build tool for the project.
